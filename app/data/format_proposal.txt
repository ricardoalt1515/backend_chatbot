5. Process Design & Treatment Alternatives
This section outlines recommended treatment technologies and possible alternatives to meet wastewater treatment objectives.
Treatment Stage
	Recommended Technology
	Alternative Option
	Primary Treatment (Pre-Treatment)
	Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) â€“ Removes fats, oils, and suspended solids.
	Coagulation & Sedimentation â€“ Less effective but lower cost.
	pH Adjustment
	Chemical Dosing (Lime, NaOH, Hâ‚‚SOâ‚„) â€“ Stabilizes pH levels.
	Aeration-Based Neutralization â€“ Slower process but chemical-free.
	Secondary Treatment (Biological Treatment)
	Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) â€“ Efficient COD/BOD reduction.
	Activated Sludge Process (ASP) â€“ Requires more space and energy.
	Tertiary Treatment (Final Polishing & Disinfection)
	Sand & Carbon Filtration â€“ Removes residual organics and solids.
	Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) â€“ High-quality effluent, higher cost.
	Disinfection
	UV Disinfection / Chlorination â€“ Eliminates pathogens.
	Ozonation â€“ More effective but energy-intensive.
	Water Reuse System (Optional)
	Reverse Osmosis (RO) / Ultrafiltration (UF) â€“ For high-quality water reuse.
	Electrodialysis (ED) â€“ Alternative for selective ion removal.
